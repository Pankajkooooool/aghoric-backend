Our Approach with Agoric

Agoric provided us with the flexibility to design reusable, composable smart contracts for gig management and payment processing. By using Agoric's ERTP (Electronic Rights Transfer Protocol) and Zoe Contracts, we achieved the following:

    Secure Escrow Mechanism:
    Enabled trustless payment handling between gig creators and freelancers.

    Composable Contracts:
    Smart contracts were designed to be modular, ensuring scalability and easy extension for future features.

    Reduced Costs:
    Leveraging Agoricâ€™s efficient consensus mechanisms resulted in significantly lower transaction fees compared to traditional centralized models.

Our collaboration with Agoricâ€™s community also ensured that we adhered to best practices in decentralized application development.
